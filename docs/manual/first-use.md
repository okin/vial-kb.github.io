## 1. Download Vial

Hop over to the [download](/download) page to make sure you have the latest build.

## 2. Run Vial

### Linux

Make sure that your downloaded file can be executed.
You can either do this through your graphical file explorer or use the following command:

```bash
chmod +x ~/Downloads/Vial*.AppImage
```

After that simply launch the application by either double clicking on it or executing the following command:

```bash
~/Downloads/Vial*.AppImage
```

If you discover any bugs please [raise an issue](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-gui/issues/new/choose).

## 3. Program your new keyboard

Using Vial is extremely simple, just click on a key you would like to change the value of in the top palette then select your replacement key or macro in the bottom palette.

Your new key will be automatically saved onto the keyboard and immediately ready for use.
